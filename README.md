# Run in Atom package [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robenkleene/run-in-atom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robenkleene/run-in-atom)

Run in Atom is an Atom package that allows code to be executed in the context of Atom itself. This means code can examine and manipulate Atom's state while it's running.

For example, running the following CoffeeScript with Run in Atom will log the contents of the current document to the console.

``` coffeescript
editor = atom.workspace.activePaneItem
editor.getText()
```

Example of calling asynchronous CoffeeScript with "Run In Atom" that triggers a visible UI change:

``` coffeescript
activePane = atom.workspaceView.getActivePaneView()
atom.project.open().then (editor) ->
  activePane.splitDown(editor)
```

## Documentation

Code can be run in the following ways. In all cases it runs the selection if it exists, otherwise the whole document. The code's result is logged to the console.

* `cmd-k r` keyboard shortcut
* Choosing "Run In Atom" from the [command palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette)
* Choosing "Run in Atom" from the contextual menu

This package is based on code from [probablycorey](https://atom.io/users/probablycorey)'s [coffee-eval](https://atom.io/packages/coffee-eval), with the following differentiating features:

* Both CoffeeScript and JavaScript are supported.
* Coffee Eval's output window has been removed.
* There's a configuration option to automatically open the developer tools when code is run.
* Code can by run from the contextual menu.
* In [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/atom/language-gfm), code can be run in fenced code blocks.


## Using as a Service

Languages beyond CoffeeScript and JavaScript can plug into Run in Atom. To this end the
respective language packages have to implement a code runner.

First declare that your language supports code runs in your `package.json`:

``` json
{
  "name": "your-language-package",
  ...
  "consumedServices": {
    "run-in-atom": {
      "versions": {
        "^2.0.0": "supportRun"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then implement the consumer method and the code runner for your language:

``` coffeescript
supportRun: (service) ->
  service.add('source.your-language', (code) => @yourLanguageRunner code)
  @disposables.add(new Disposable -> service.remove('source.your-language'))
```

The `add` and `remove` methods expect your language grammar scope as parameter.
